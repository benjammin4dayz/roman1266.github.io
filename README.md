## Transfer Ownership of GitHub Pages Repository

To give you control over the website, I will transfer ownership of the [GitHub Pages repository](https://github.com/benjammin4dayz/roman12663.github.io) to you. Here are some important details:

- Don't worry, GitHub will provide warnings before you make any irreversible changes, and there are backups available.
- You will receive a confirmation email from GitHub regarding the ownership transfer.
- Once the transfer is complete, you will be able to use the domain `roman12663.github.io` for **free**

#### After ownership has been transferred

Now that you are the new owner of the `roman12663.github.io` repository, you may have to add me as a collaborator and adjust my privileges accordingly so that I can continue to maintain the site.

Follow [this link](https://github.com/roman12663/roman12663.github.io/settings/access) to view the collaborator settings for this repository and add `@benjammin4dayz`.

## How this works

This website is a static site served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Here's what that means:

- A static site is a website made up of fixed files that are delivered to the user's web browser as they are. It doesn't require server-side processing or a database.
- Think of it like a book. Once the site is deployed, the content is written and can't be changed until a new edition is printed.
- However, this design includes embeds that connect to other services like Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok. These services do use server-side processing and databases.
- This allows us to serve fresh content without manually updating the entire site.

- GitHub and the embeds to related services like TikTok, YouTube, and Twitch have their own practices and policies.
